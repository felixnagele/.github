# Contributing

Thanks, any help is welcome. Keep changes small and focused.

## Workflow

1. Fork and create a branch, e.g. `feature/short-description`, `fix/short-description` or `test/short-description`.
2. Make changes and run tests or linters if present.
3. Commit with a short imperative message like `Add X` or `Fix Y`.
4. Open a pull request to `main` and use the available PR template.

If the change is large, open an issue first to discuss (please use the provided issue template).

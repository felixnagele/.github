# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Preferred: open a private GitHub Security Advisory if available, or create an issue using the security template or label.
If you need a private reply, open a private GitHub Security Advisory when possible.
Otherwise include your GitHub handle in the report and I will reply on GitHub.
Note that this is a personal account and I may not be able to review every report.

## What to include

If you use the security issue template it will collect the key details.
Otherwise please include the affected commit or version, clear reproduction steps, and a short impact summary.
Logs or a minimal proof of concept are helpful but optional.

## Acknowledgement and disclosure

I may acknowledge reports when I can.
Do not rely on a response.
I prefer coordinated disclosure.
If you plan to publish details please give reasonable time to address the issue.
